       Hey there! My name is Joy and I'm a full stack developer that loves problem solving and a good challenge. I love to build products and witness them come to life while being part of the process.<br /> I wasn't always a developer- in fact, pretty far from it. I used to be a professional musician and spent most of my time performing or practicing. Now I love to spend my time coding and developing and expanding my skillset.<br />If you have any questions or would like to know anything in further detail, please don't hesitate to contact me through the contact information under the contact tab!
